[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/M4M212BC7C)

**Export Expressions** is an After Effects ScriptUI designed to export expressions from your entire project, active or selected compositions. The script allows motion designers to extract and save the expressions used in their After Effects projects as a `.jsx` file for easier management, reuse, and documentation.

    - **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects (version)\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels`
    - **MaC OS:** Available soon
3. Alternatively, in After Effects, go to `File > Scripts > Install ScriptUI Panel` select the script file (`EF_Export-Expressions.jsx`) and restart After Effects.

## Features
